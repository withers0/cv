            <h3>Real-Time Multiplayer Video Game | Java</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented a multiplayer game server in Java that handles client connections, synchronizes game
                    state between two players, and enables real-time gameplay.</li>
                <li>Utilized multithreading to manage input and output streams for each player, ensuring seamless updates of player
                    positions, obstacle coordinates, and number of lives.</li>
                <li>Employed sockets for client-server communication and data streams for efficient data exchange.</li>
                <li>Applied object-oriented programming principles to design modular game elements like obstacles, players, and
                    game user interface, improving code organization and reusability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lifestyle Tracker Application | Java</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a console-based application in Java that allows users to log and manage their food intake and
                    physical activity, tracking calorie consumption and expenditure.</li>
                <li>Implemented functionality for users to generate reports, view and edit historical records, and delete entries,
                    enhancing user interaction and data management.</li>
                <li>Utilized robust command processing to facilitate user inputs for various commands such as "Food," "Activity,"
                    "Report," and "History," that allow the user to interact with the different features of the application.</li>

            <h3>Car Accident Predictor | Python</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a car accident based on vehicle year, make, model, condition, and real-time weather conditions.</li>
                <li>Collected and processed datasets on vehicle characteristics, accident statistics, and weather patterns using Python.</li>
                <li>Incorporated APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve real-time weather data for user-specific locations.</li>
                <li>Applied data visualization techniques to present predictions and key factors influencing accident risk.</li>
